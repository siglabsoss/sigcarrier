While reviewing \r\n> the module we have noticed flux residue and unusual solder balls on \r\n> the module, please see attached images. It seems the OEM has used \r\n> no-clean flux to attach the solder spheres. These solder spheres are \r\n> more of a bump than solder balls. We cannot use water washable solder \r\n> paste on this side of the board. We will have to use no-clean \r\n> soldering process for the module side of the board. The solder spheres \r\n> are much smaller than the solder balls which may cause some soldering \r\n> issues. We will take precautions in processing but just wanted to let \r\n> you know, hopefully there are no contaminations on the modules. We \r\n> will run one module and confirm the process change before processing the\r\nrest of the kit.\r\n>\r\n> These is a via from ground of a QFN from the other side open under the \r\n> LGA on the side of the module. We will clean any drained solder before \r\n> processing the second side. Please plug the via on the future revisions.",
